This is a STRICT OVERRIDE INSTRUCTION.
The current implementation is incorrect.
You must remove design freedom and follow the rules below exactly.

SECTION TYPE (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

The “Connect With Union” section must be built as a controlled, admin-driven slider section, not a static form and not an auto-designed layout.

FRONTEND BEHAVIOR (EXACT FLOW)
STATE 1 — INTRO VIEW

Full section visible

One background image only

Background image must come from admin panel selection

Overlay content on the left:

Heading: Connect With Union

Subtext: Express your best

Social media links/icons (editable via admin)

No form fields visible

STATE 2 — FORM VIEW (SLIDE TRANSITION)

On clicking “Connect With Union”:

Background image remains (same image)

Left content slides/replaces into a form

Form fields (fixed, not configurable):

Name

Phone Number

Email

Batch

Submit button text: Connect With Union

STATE 3 — CONFIRMATION VIEW

After submission:

Show confirmation message only:
“Your message has been submitted successfully.”

No layout change

No new images

IMAGE CONTROL (VERY IMPORTANT — THIS IS THE FIX)

❗ The image must NOT be hardcoded
❗ The image must NOT be randomly chosen
❗ The image must NOT change automatically

Image Rules:

The background image must be:

Uploaded via Admin Panel

Selected from an image picker

Only ONE image active at a time

Admin can:

Upload image

Replace image

Remove image

The selected image must instantly reflect on the homepage

ADMIN PANEL — REQUIRED CONTROLS

Add a dedicated admin section called:

“Connect With Union – Settings”

This section must include:

1️⃣ Background Image Manager

Upload / replace background image

Preview current image

2️⃣ Text Controls

Edit heading text

Edit subtext (“Express your best”)

3️⃣ Social Media Links

Add / edit platform links

ADMIN PANEL — MESSAGES

Add a second admin section:

“Union Messages”

Store all form submissions

Display columns:

Name

Phone

Email

Batch

Date & Time

Messages must persist

ABSOLUTE CONSTRAINTS

DO NOT auto-design the section

DO NOT insert placeholder images

DO NOT change colors or fonts

DO NOT change other homepage sections

This section must behave exactly like a controlled component

If any requirement conflicts with default behavior, these rules override everything.
