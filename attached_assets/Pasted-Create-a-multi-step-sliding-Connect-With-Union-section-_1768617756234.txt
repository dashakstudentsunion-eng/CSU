Create a multi-step sliding “Connect With Union” section by STRICTLY referring to the uploaded video.

This section must work as a step-by-step slider, not a static form.
Do NOT redesign the website. Only add this section exactly as shown in the video.

SECTION STRUCTURE (VERY IMPORTANT)

The section should behave like this:

STEP 1 – IMAGE VIEW (Initial State)

Display one full image on the right side, exactly like the video

On the left side, show text only:

Heading: “Connect With Union”

Subtext: “Express your best”

Below that, show social media platform icons/links (Instagram, WhatsApp, Email, etc.)

No form fields visible in this step

STEP 2 – FORM SLIDE IN (On Interaction)

When the user clicks “Connect With Union” or scrolls/interacts:

The right-side image slides or transitions

The form appears on the left side, replacing the text smoothly

Form Fields (Exact Order):

Name

Phone Number

Email

Batch

Button text: “Connect With Union”

Smooth animation exactly like the video

No page reload

STEP 3 – SUBMISSION STATE

After successful submission:

Show a clean confirmation message:
“Your message has been submitted successfully.”

Maintain the same layout and smooth transition style

IMAGE BEHAVIOR (CRITICAL)

Only one image at a time

Image must:

Match the size, placement, and flow shown in the video

Change or animate subtly during slide transitions

Do NOT show posters, schedules, or unrelated graphics

Do NOT use random placeholder images

ADMIN PANEL – MESSAGES & CONTENT CONTROL

Extend the Admin Panel with two new sections:

1️⃣ Union Messages

Store every submitted form entry

Display messages in a clean table with:

Name

Phone Number

Email

Batch

Date & Time

2️⃣ Connect With Union Content

Ability to:

Change the right-side image

Edit the left-side text (“Express your best”)

Update social media links

Changes must reflect instantly on the homepage.

STRICT CONSTRAINTS

Follow the uploaded video exactly

This is a step-based animated section, not a static form

Do NOT change:

Navigation

Colors

Other homepage sections

Keep everything:

Clean

Premium

Student-union focused
