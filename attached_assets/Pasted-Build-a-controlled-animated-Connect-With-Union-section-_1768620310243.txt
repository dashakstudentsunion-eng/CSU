Build a controlled, animated “Connect With Union” section by STRICTLY following the uploaded video reference.
This is NOT a static section. This is NOT a free-form design.
Follow the interaction flow and layout EXACTLY as described below.

INITIAL VIEW (STATE 1 – IMAGE FIRST)

The section should first display ONE large image covering the section area

On the bottom of the image, overlay the text:
“Connect With Union”

No form fields visible

No split layout yet

This image must come from Admin Panel selection

INTERACTION TRIGGER (STATE 2 – SPLIT TRANSITION)

When the user scrolls to the section OR interacts with the image/text:

The layout transitions into a two-column split

LEFT SIDE (TEXT + SOCIALS)

After the split:

Left side must show:

Heading: Connect With Union

Subtext: Express your best

A list of social media platforms/icons (Instagram, WhatsApp, Email, etc.)

No form on the left

Clean, minimal, vertically centered

RIGHT SIDE (FORM – SLIDE IN)

The right side panel slides in from the right

This sliding panel contains the form only

Form Fields (FIXED ORDER):

Name

Phone Number

Email

Batch

Button text: Connect With Union

Smooth slide-in animation exactly like the video

No page reload on submit

SUBMISSION STATE (STATE 3)

After successful submission:

Replace the form with the message:
“Your message has been submitted successfully.”

Keep the same split layout

IMAGE RULES (CRITICAL – NO EXCEPTIONS)

The image:

Must be uploaded and selected from Admin Panel

Must NOT be hardcoded

Must NOT be randomly chosen

Only ONE image active at a time

Image stays consistent across all states

ADMIN PANEL (MANDATORY)

Add a dedicated admin section called:

“Connect With Union – Controls”

Admin must be able to:

Upload / replace the background image

Preview the active image

Edit:

Heading text

Subtext (“Express your best”)

Social media links

ADMIN PANEL – MESSAGES

Add another admin section:

“Union Messages”

Store all submitted entries

Display in table format:

Name

Phone Number

Email

Batch

Date & Time

STRICT CONSTRAINTS

Do NOT redesign the section

Do NOT insert placeholder or unrelated images

Do NOT change colors, fonts, or other homepage sections

This must behave like a state-based animated component, not a static block

If default behavior conflicts with this, these rules override everything.
